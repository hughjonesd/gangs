<h1>Instructions</h1>

<p>In this experiment, you will interact with a group of <b><%= gs %>
participants</b>. You will stay with this group throughout the experiment.</p>

<p>Each participant in the group is identified by one of <%= length(mycolours) %>
colours. You will start with a randomly allocated colour, but you may be able
to change it during the experiment.</p>

<h2>Periods</h2>
<p>The experiment has <%= n_reps %> periods. Each period has the following
stages:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Picking a colour.</b> Each group member's colour is shown on screen. 
<%= n_change_cols %> of the participants are allowed to pick a new colour, 
which can be the same or different as their old colour. The other 
<%= gs - n_change_cols %> participants cannot change their colour.</li>
<li><b>Picking a target.</b> See below.
<li><b>Results.</b> The computer displays which group members targeted whom,
and each member's earnings from this period.</li>
</ol>

<p>After the <%= n_reps %> periods, you will be shown your earnings. 
In addition to your earnings from all the periods, you will receive a
Â£2.50 showup fee. There will then be a short questionnaire. 
Finally, you will be paid privately and will be free to go.</p>

<h2>Picking a target</h2>
<p>All group members start each period with <%= ukp(endowment) %>.</p>
<p>In the second stage of each period, you may <b>pick another group member as a target</b>. Picking a target costs <%= ukp(tcost) %>. Alternatively, you may
pick nobody, at no cost.</p>

<p>If you and at least <%= min_targeters - 1 %> other person choose
the same target, then <b>the target loses <%= ukp(endowment) %> and 
this is shared among all those who picked them</b>.</p>

<div style="background: #DDD; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; 
      padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 5px; 
      padding-bottom: 5px; border-radius: 10px;">
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>If 3 people all choose the same group member as a target, then the target
loses <%= ukp(endowment) %> and each of the 3 people gains <%= ukp(endowment/3) %>.</p>
</div>

<p>You cannot earn less than 0 pence in any period. If you earn a negative
amount, it will be adjusted up to 0 pence.</p>
<h2>Picking group members</h2>

<p>When you choose a target, group members will be shown on their screen,
identified by their colour. Clicking on a group member will pick them as a target.</p>
<p>Other group members will see the same colours, but in a different order. See
the two example screenshots below.</p>

order.</figcaption>
